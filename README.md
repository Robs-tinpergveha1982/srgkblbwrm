OMG just finished watching Warfare, dude. Like, what did I just see?! Seriously, my brain is still kinda fried. You know how you watch something and are basically like, What even was that? That was me. Totally insane, right? The explosions were just... wow, they hit different. And that plot twist, didn’t see that coming!

But seriously, who writes these characters? Half the time I'm just sitting there like, “Is this real life?” Some lines were so cheesy, I’m pretty sure cheddar would be jealous. Those dialogues, man. I swear they hire someone just to come up with the most bizarre sentences ever. Remember when we used to download the movie before even realizing what it's like? Sometimes feels like that's still a thing for these scripts!

And that sound editing tho, was like being punched in the face by a drum, hahaha. I kinda wish they wouldn’t go so heavy on that bass, but maybe that’s just me being old. You ever just listen to critics and then watch the movie yourself and be like, do you all have ears? Madness!

> But that one scene – you know the one, right? The one with all the chaos and the one guy who's like dodging everything because plot armor, obviously. For a moment I thought he actually might get hit, then noooope! Haha, not today! Action movie logic at its best, I guess.

Btw, how did you feel about the ending? Felt like they just gave up and let the AI script it after that second act. I swear I saw a cat jumble on a keyboard and that was their script for the last 30 minutes. And now I'm sitting here like, why didn't I learn from last time?! But yeah, it was a ride, no lie.

> let chaos = absolute;

But anyway, enough about me ranting about it. Let me know when you see it, we can just sit here and laugh about plot holes or the epic randomness. Also, can we grab pizza this weekend? I need something way more satisfying than that movie finale, LOL.
